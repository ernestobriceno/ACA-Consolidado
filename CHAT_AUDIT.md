# Chat Integration Audit

This document summarizes the final integration steps for the real time chat feature.

## Overview
- Socket.IO server created under `Backend/ChatServer`.
- React component `Chat.jsx` communicates via WebSockets and handles message history and moderation errors.
- FastAPI moderation service uses Detoxify to block toxic content.

## Verification
- `pytest -q` executed in `Backend/MicroserviceModeration` passes (requires torch & detoxify download).
- `npm test` in `Backend/ChatServer` runs (currently prints "No tests implemented").
- Manual tests confirm that messages are stored in `messages.json` and rejected messages trigger toast notifications.

## Legacy Removal
- Previous legacy chat implementation has been removed. No leftover `chat/` folder or old server files remain.
